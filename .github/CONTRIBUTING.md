# Contributing to ContactAPI

Thanks for your interest in ContactAPI. 

## Getting Started

ContactAPI's [open issues are here](https://github.com/animesh2712/ContactAPI/issues). 
An easy way to get started helping the project is to *file an issue*. 
Issues can include bugs to fix, features to add, or documentation that looks outdated. 

## Contributions

ContactAPI welcomes contributions from everyone.

Contributions to ContactAPI should be made in the form of GitHub pull requests. Each pull request will
be reviewed by a core contributor.

## Pull Request Checklist

- Seed branch from the master branch and, if needed, rebase to the current master
  branch before submitting your pull request. If it doesn't merge cleanly with
  master you may be asked to rebase your changes.

- Commits should be as small as possible, while ensuring that each commit is
  correct independently (i.e., each commit should compile and pass tests). 

- Add tests relevant to the fixed bug or new feature.
